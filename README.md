gwlib-strap
===========

Package which contains image assets and css stylesheets used across GW Libraries web apps, as well as the html structure for the header and footer of the 'Libheader Lite' branding.

It packages the assets from our Libsite-Header-Lite bootswatch: https://github.com/gwu-libraries/Libsite-Header-Lite. These header and footer static-files will be installed under site-packages, so they can be used by any GW Libraries site.

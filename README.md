Package which contains the image, and css stylesheets regularly used in GW Libraries web apps.
It packages the assets from our Libsite-Header-Lite bootswatch: https://github.com/gwu-libraries/Libsite-Header-Lite
These header and footer static-files will be installed under site-packages, so they can be used by any GW Libraries site.

The static assets are being moved to our new AppAssets 'cdn' server.
There are some updates coming to the assets themselves in the Libsite-Header-Lite bootswatch.
